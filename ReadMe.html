<p>I’m Mark “sealfin” Bishop, a student (and participating in programming competitions to try to be accepted to study at a university here in the UK) and an indie developer; I blog at <a href="http://AModernPrometheus.WordPress.com/">http://AModernPrometheus.WordPress.com/</a>.</p>

<p>In 2012 I stumbled upon-, and participated in-, the first Advent Programming Contest organised by the IEEE Student Branch Klagenfurt (with support from Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt and Universität Passau); in spite of it being the first programming competition that I ever participated in-, and in spite of my having no traditional qualifications in computer science-, I achieved a rank of 11<sup>th</sup>	(out of 118 participants).</p>

<p>Participating in that programming competition aroused in me a love of competitive programming, and I participated in a flurry of programming competitions in the following year, although nowadays the programming competitions that I’m participating in are “just” <a href="http://ProgrammingPraxis.com/">Programming Praxis</a>, <a href="http://ProjectEuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, and <a href="http://CodeAbbey.com/">CodeAbbey</a>.</p>

<p>At present, these functions only try to detect problems with the platform that they are running on (eg., not being able to allocate memory) or (what are likely to be) user input errors (eg., trying to convert into an unsigned integer a string containing non-digit characters); at present, these functions do not try to detect (what are likely to be) programmer errors (eg., passing <code>NULL</code> to a function when that function expects the address of a variable to be passed to it).</p>
